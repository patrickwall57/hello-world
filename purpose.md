# Enterprise API Standards and Guidelines

As Asurion's API footprint continues to expand, we adhere to a set of standards to ensure that Asurion's APIs are simple to understand, consistent in their behavior, and intuitive in their use. This repository outlines the guidelines and best practices for developing APIs within Asurion, and serves as a reference for teams to ensure that their APIs meet the requirements for consistency, maintainability, and usability. This standard aims to guide teams in delivering APIs that best represent Asurion both to internal and external partners.

This standard is:
- A collaborative and peer-reviewed set of documents that teams should adopt when building apis for internal and external partners
- Representitive of the development community within Asurion
- Intended to ensure that Asurion's APIs are consistent with existing [internet standards](https://www.ietf.org/standards/) and industry leaders (*editors note - lets add an influences document where we can link relevant rfcs, industry leader docs etc*)

This standard is not:
- a mandate to refactor all of your code
- an assessment of any previous API or technology choice made at Asurion
